This is an extremely lightweight (experimental) javascript implementation of a genetic algorithm, used to "plan" a permaculture garden. Proof of concept only.

All of the code is written in "functional programming" style, which makes it very easy to adapt.

Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

`npm start` will run the "game" sample.
